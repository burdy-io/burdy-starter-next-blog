This is a [Burdy](https://burdy.io) and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-burdy-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-burdy-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) with your browser to see the result.

To access the admin panel open [http://localhost:4000/admin](http://localhost:4000/admin).

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

Burdy is mapped to `/api/*` and `/admin/*`.
